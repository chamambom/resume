## üóû Projects | Accomplishments
_This section accounts for all high value projects (revenue and complexity) that i executed._
<br><br>
**Organisation** - [Irvines Group ](https://www.irvinesafrica.com/)<br>
**Project summary** - Irvines has operations in SouthAfrica , Bostwana ,Zambia ,Mozambique and Zimbabwe , I developed a cloud migration roadmap that required us to consolidate 
all their on-premise applications while maintaining a hybrid environment using IPSec VPNs to facilitate a gradual migration of their applications to Azure. <br>
**Existing Environment** - Irvines Group has business applications and network devices (HR management app , ERP app and etc,
 Sophos and Mikrotik firewalls) located . The ERP software running automatica was migrated to a managed SQL db while most of the applications 
 due to compatibility were hosted on SQL server hosted on a virtual machine)<br>
**Requirements. Planned Changes** - <br>
**Period** - year 2020 <br>
**Challenges Experienced** -
 - We initially scoped the applications to be hosted on Azure SQL but we were faced with compatibility issues from legacy code and 
 we settled for Azure SQL managed instance which caters for an on-prem lift and shift.
 - Hybrid connectivity between Azure and irvines offices (with a mix of Mikrotiks and Sophos firewalls) - had overlapping subnets which needed to be changed. Additionally 
 because of teleworking , Irvines already had remote SSL VPNs configured for their users to connect to on-premise applications.Instead of configuring native azure P2S tunnels
  we extended traffic originating from the remote SSL vpn subnet into azure to reduce networking complexity .
 - Access requirements required that we centralise some applications didnt support AD authentication ,
